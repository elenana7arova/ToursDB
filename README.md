# ToursDB
iOS app to CRUD realm database for a tours company

This app was made as a course work.
It allows you to manipulate with 5 tables: clients, cities, hotels, tours and vouchers. You can add, edit and delete objects through the interface of the app.
Also the tables are connected. For example every hotel is associated with a city, every tour is associated with a hotel and its city. 
Also vouchers connect clients with tours.

When you delete some connected information it is also deleted from associated objects.
If you edit some connected information it also affects all of the associated objects.

Made on SWIFT 5 with Realm.
